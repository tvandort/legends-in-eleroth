Communion:

Basic military bootcamp to prepare. Condition your body to be able to. Sound mind and strong body required. Generally prefered for you to be older. At least 18, no children do this.

No one has died doing this. Only from complications after.

Parts of you would almost like fall off and get snapped by Thanos.
