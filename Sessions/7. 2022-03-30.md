2talked to barkeep about jayce.
leave a false trail for our opponents that seems uh like an irresponsible idea.

started to head to bounty board and then mely's friend.

Stopped by stables to pay up for more time and ask if theres any interesting goings on if the stable runner knew anything.

go to center of town see bounty / job board. crowded by the board people are talking about jayce and that he's missing.

Breda keeps an eye on the crowd for anyone shifty while Mely goes to talk to Naomi.

Mely, Renry, and Katiz question Naomi she says to go check his house.

Jayce's house is on the east side of town, jones way head north.

We convine Naomi to step up as the current flower leader or at least try to after breda gives her guidance.

We head to Jayce's house, its nicer but not super nicer than the neighbors.

The door's lock seems to be broken.

door was jammed forced it open

broken glass places looks like the place has been turned.

kitchen on left, storage closet on the right
far back of the house we see a bedframe
one other door that is still closed
magic pops on the door
illusion magic on the door

storage closet has random clothing and stuff

far left is bedroom
right is the closed door with magic

dream journel details dreams of having a statue erected in his

theres a polished wooden shaft (dildo?) under mattress lmao.

too much door thinking not enough door talking. renry tries to open it but its locked.

Breda kicks in the door after Renry asks if anyone is good at locks.

office.

stacked papers, bookshelf.

some information about geopolitics.

racks for scrolls.

looks like the office back in jesrala kinda.

whys this guy got a bunch of maps he lives here. maybe civil planning?

desk has two locked drawers. 

we all hear a voice that we havent heard in a while coming from the door.

A blueish silhouette of a mouth appears on the door and we hear it say:
I have forests but no trees.
I have cities but no people.
I have rivers but no water. 
What am I?

probably a map is the answer.

map has a very distinct red blotch on the east side forrest line. the rest of the map looks completely normal like bloomenfeld.

voice from the door was Larrahn.

Mely gives a newsy some silver to give a letter she wrote to Naomi about whats up with Jayce's place.

---

go through gate get close to forest. Seems like fog is coalescing there.

Mely's hand starts hurting.

Renry starts making mist and it starts fighting with the fog (???).

As we enter the treeline and start getting into the woods it gets dark like night time.

feeling we're getting from the area feels wrong.

the trees are covered in spiderwebs

it is dead silent here. there is no animal life.

Calcite hears something and a giant spider bites into his neck.

forest has lots of spiders. after killing the first one we start heading towards the spiders.

a second spider attacks calcite. a wave of spiders go for katiz, a spider goes for renry.
