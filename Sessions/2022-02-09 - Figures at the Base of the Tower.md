Recap:

Everyone celebrated during the festival. Chaos caused by some rude customers and not by others. Some enjoyed a glass of wine with friends while others enjoyed a parade. Everyone through developing of strangerly bonds through a few people decided to take a trek down to the tower together.

[[Melyana]] discovered the ability to change something on the tower inevitably causing a break in the tower causing a bunch of light to eminate from the tower and the water. A bunch of folks disappeared. We had strange dreams.

We all woke up and are trying to figure out what happened.

---

Approach the shadows in the mist it grows darker. 10' away it begins to swirl in the mist like it's solidifying into a humanoid shape. Blackish smoke comes from the tip of the thing to the ground and creates a humanoid figure that's an elf. Blanch white hair fair but pitch black skin seems to shimmer blue with the fog and sun coming through. Eyes gleam purple with cracks around the eyes. Ears with gold piercings and studs. Half plate armor with 8 point star in center breast with red jewel.

Came from inside the tower? Not really inside the tower.

Larrahn is their name.

The 8 point star with ruby is a common symbol for Lolth.

Seems intent to be an asshole.

Warps in a Duergar and something thats flesh blobby pretty lumpy. Green pale skin kinda bat-like?

Larrahn hotboxes herself out.

Three other shapes come at us.

Dispatched the Ooze boy and the Gray Dwarf pretty handily but the dwarf had a bunch of armor it seems and pretty high strength.

Dwarf had money and necklace with a triangle with a pentagram in it with a red arrow down throught it. It's the symbol of asmodeus.

After the baddies died the fog started to receed. People are starting to return. 

Horned everyone awake. 

Jessrala knights ride up about 6?

Jordel is the night commander.

Jordel requests us to come with him back to Jesrala.

We talk on the way back. Mely doesn't want to talk about what she saw at the tower in front of guards.

----

## Jesrala
Jordel brings us to a big guard house. 

Big wooden three story building. Looks like a place soldiers would stay when taking shifts on top of the walls.

> J: sedall know that we're here.

Fairly large room for a capitain

### In the guard building
Jordel takes a statement from [[Melyana]].

Leaves to go report.

We check for listening devices.

[[Katiz]] implies someone may have known this was going to happen.

[[Zidall]], very ornate robes in the colors of [[the Shevet]]. Human.

Thousands of years ago the tower also did a lighty thing. 5 original individuals (voices) this has happened to before.

Came through the tower and spoke to the five original bodies. 5 souls of the contract.

Jordel not looking at [[Zidall]] out of reverence.

Jordel leaves the room.

> Z: The contract that kept the power in check. It seems the last time the light was seen was the last time that the power leaked out into the world.

[[Zidall]] doesn't know what the planes relate to the tower specifically for. Pauses when Mely mentions #the-chains. 

> Z: Some say the chains keep the planes together but this isn't true.

5 Contracts passed down through blood lines.

[[Zidall]] claims that there are claims that there are 5 bloodlines alive today still.

Original 5 lost to time. Current 5 are any possiblility. Bloodline passed and mingled through so many different people, families, eternal beings.

Signal of power leaking out that should not be here anymore.

If light is here now that something happened to original five souls.

Locks in place, locks have loosened.

Dragons attempted to keep the towers power in check. Something inside fought against them. Created great scar across the western side of the planet.

Put locks back in place?

Few dragons exist but are alone and keep to themselves.

Perhaps someone can help us find the 5 souls? Can give us insight into the original five.

Directs us to a woman in Gorfelno by the name of Amira Monty. Her name appears a few times in here.

Large dragon in north of Dumeilin that is studied by students but no one else is allowed in.
