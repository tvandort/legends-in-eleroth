Single cloaked person with a long billowing charcoal peacoat. Golden filligree over shoulders and chest area. gold chains going in and out of idfferent pockets on its breast and sides.

30ft in front of us. 

Calcite tells the figure that they're on the material plane.

Takes round gold object again. 

> Well I suppose it was correct. Material Plane... I've not been here in, well... I don't know what it's been.

Lower's their hood. Very pale white face with blanch white hair with the facial features that are pointed and angular but very curved around the eyes. THey have beautful red eyes that don't glow but looks surprising so it stands out.

The wagon has sitting shelf 10 feet off the ground. They hop off and land on the dirt.

Brown leather gloved hand reaches around on the ground and rubs it between their fingers.

Asks if we're interested in trade gesturing towards the wagon.

9' tall 8' wide 12' long

one side has a mural of 16 spheres that overlap like a venn diagram. textured raised off of wood. 

Renry asks to trade. Figure knocks on wagon and the top pops off and falls down. The side of the wagon opens up and becomes like a storefront. Cloud of dust rains off of it. 

A room that shouldn't fit inside the wagon. On the wall of the wagon hits the ground. It hits the deck creatures a round wooden chair with tea set already made steam comes out.

U shaped store like countertop that looks like it goes further into the wagon than should fit there.

Apparently stock is new every day. 

They go get a giant cauldron with swirling blue smoke to check the inventory.

Aunn is their name.

Cauldron is shallow and wide 

trades in all sorts of magic things. due to arrangement the inventory changes every plane.

Mural like thing is the Great Wheel, aka all the planes overlapping.

Quadrants are the elemental planes, might be what's on Mely's hand. Correlated to great wheel diagram.

Circle that's fading is the top right is the water plane.

Aunn says that Lahrahn's name sounds like its from the abyss maybe.

Aunn doesn't know their own home anymore. For at least 500 years.

Maybe Mount Celestia or Elysuim? Doesn't know though.

Different places have different times.

Was most recently in the Feywild.

Watch is a plane locator.

Renry sticks her hand in cauldron. It's cold for a minute. Her hand touches metal.

Gets nothing.

Aunn's hand goes far into the cauldron. Pulls out a little ring.

Tea tastes earthy to Calcite but fruity and floraly to Breda.

Ring has gemstone that kinda disappears. It's a ring of teleportation.

Renry asks how much. It's 5 gold?

Only Aunn can fish items from the magic bowl.

ring, mystery key, bottle, potion of hydration, crystal vial in the shape of an angel with 4 wings looks like light colored sand inside of it.

dust of disappearance

spehere inside their hand with philaments of blue and white spiral shapes. drift globe. 

Aunn says Mely's tattoo is a map of the elemental planes.

Aunn is also looking for her old memories.

Going through Astral plane is usually pretty empty. Now turbulent? Lack of balance?

Pocket that Aunn puts gold into never gets any bigger.


Gives Mely a summoning whistle.

Room zuccs up back into the truck.

next half day to 1pm before we hit the outpost

twin (something) frontier

10ft wooden spikes

moat around outputs with drawbridge

road is going from wooded to marshland.

get in line for outpost. Katiz forgets to hide his key.

mely and katiz depart to try to teleport over the river.

guards look at calcite strangely. kinda give him side eye.

We get through unhassled but the guards seem to be whispering about us with some suspicion about something. Related to how Calcite is dressed?

Mely teleports Katiz over the river then leaves.

The group of 3 gets across the river over the bridge and park somewhere out of sight.

The ring shows up on Renry's finger. 

It's the "leave me behind sign". no man gets left behind except for when Renry doesn't feel like getting up.

The rest of us go off into the distance.
