# The Festival

Our journey begins in Jasrala the capital of [[The Shevet]].

See the tower in all its glory and make you understand how much of a treasure it is to them.

7 days this festival lasts, today we start on the 5th day.

Inevitably people come to enjoy the final day even if they're here for other reasons.

---

## The Fifth Day
### The Market

Giant rows, 5 person abrest going north and 5 going south.

Some douchebag tries to tell [[Breda]] he could make her wares cheaper and that she couldn't have made them all.

Calcite stops by as I scare the douchebag off.

---

## The Sixth Day
### The Stadium
Close to the size of a football field. Lrage stones n shit. Going at it fights, spell slinging.

In a small booth that is near the center of the field slightly elevated is Katiz.

5'5" half orc, red bandana with his hair in a ponytail. Half hung over looking around taking in the crowd thinking of his glory days doing the same.

Small ball on chain around neck rolling it around in his fingers lost in thought.

Wolfren vs Utheria game. Katiz seems to be commenting.

Wolfren:
Centaur
Werewolf
Two Dwarves
Aarokorcra

Utheria:
at least 2 Elves
Halfling
Warforged

Wolfren 10 people against 5.

Two mic stands using Thaumaturgy.

Two elves taken out by the werewolf.

Wave of bluish energy erupts from halfling, hits someone and gets flung back 20 feet.

Utherian spellcaster attempts to lightning bolt through the field and attempts to hit last wolfren person but instead hits another human who they were stiff arming.

As soon as the last Wolfren gets hits its 2 Utherians left.

Utherians win as underdogs.

Katiz recognizes Baker. 

> B: did you enjoy a little taste of the old life?
> K: Honestly its just a sore reminder at this point of what could have been. But it pays the bills.
> B: It pays the bills? I thought we pay the bills.
> B: I would never want an employee to stop understanding they are working for us whether they want to or not.
> K: What do you want?
> B: Always to business with you.

Takes out a paper parcel wrapped in twine.

> B: You know the drill, usual deaddrops, usual locations. There's a bench that I've marked with an X, hard to miss you've seen it before.
> K: I'll take care of it.
> B: I know you will Katiz you've always done good work with me.

Katiz fights the urge to push this guy out of the booth so badly.

---

### Games area

Katiz goes to the games area to find the bench.

Similar to the market there are a bunch of stalls, but where you'd usually find food you see games setup stuff any sort of games.

From cornhole to guessing games, to pop the baloon. All sorts of street games.

We meet someone who is eye up these games very intently.

Renry: Standing somewhat impatiently looking around at games figuring out where to go first.

Tall but not super tall.

Long colorful skirt with a big slit in it.

Here to cause some mayhem and chaos

Feels some kind of wind or force guiding her. 

Renry comes across a test of strength. One of those mallet games.

Big orc comes up to the game after being drawn in by the dwarf running the game. Decent mallet, probably 50 pounds. Picks it up like its nothing. 

The spring that moves the metal up to the bell seems a little fucked up like its been used too many times. 

Nearby there's a booth selling meat skewers and small cages with some animals in it.

First nat 20 for 24 is for Renry. She walks up to the side of the booth to the six individual cages. Each one is filled with 4 or 5 little furry animals. Chipmunks, squirrels, mice rats. Everyone is either looking at the orc who's destroying the test of strength or the skewers being like "idk about that man." 

Renry sidles up to the side of it gives it a quick turn and no one even notices her there.

Renry lets her mouse run down her arm as she goes to free the animals. She feels that wind thing again and now they suddenly all look up at her. Most of them were resigned but now they look up.

Renry smiles brightly at them and goes to open the cage in a quiet manner.

Calcite is walking by but completely misses this.

Animals burst out some onlookers scream. THe animals run out into the street.

Vendor goes 
> OH SHIT NOT AGAIN

Renry is a fucking ham lmao.

Tries to amp up the people freaking out.

Goes up to people like "oh my god did you see their teeth and nails so horrible!"

Animals run towards orc a squirrel latches onto his leg, two more rats go right in his field of view, and he freaks the fuck out and flings the hammer down clipping the wood, swinging so hard while letting out a high pitch scream that the weight goes fucking flying sailing into the sky.

Orc flings the mallot away and runs screaming in a high pitched voice "OH DONT TOUCH ME."

A crowd gathers around the chaos.

Vendor is running through the crowd with a bloody cleaver trying to get his merchandise back.

Calcite chases after him asking for a statement. 

Vendor realises he's yelling at the guard and shuts down.

Calcite is holding his big tomb trying to get out a small notebook.

> C: Yes what is your statement.
> V: My, my animals got out and I need them back.
> *C: Closes notebook*
> C: OK Thank you!

Vendor slowly takes cleaver back out and dashes off.

Renry goes around telling the story embellishing each time so that the story becomes a known thing.

The legend of the furry animal army gets around. Everyone knows about the gigantic rat that took a bite out an orc and an orc that tried to beat his way out of a crowd. The story has really taken on a life of its own.

Renry is pleased with herself.

--- 

Katiz picks up the package he was directed to. About 5 pounds soft, a little give with something that isn't soft too.

Considers opening the parcel. Just before he finishes opening it he stops himself realizing that it would be hard to make it look like he's found it. Puts the parcel where he would normally put it.

Pulls a roll of cloth with a slick of tar on it and sticks it to the bottom of the bench.

Katiz lifts a couple of meat sticks.

Renry notices a half orc walk up to the stall grabbing two skewers.

Renry leans in close taxes Katiz.

> K: I hate taxes...
> *K: Grabs a third and hands it to Renry*

Some other people now go up and take some of the skewers as well.

---

## The night before the final day

The big night parade before the final day. City is alight with laterns colorful patterns of paper. Occasional fireworks blowing up in the sky.

Along this big main street tons of floats that people have created are on show. We come over to the left of the parade where a big crowd is gathered.

Behind a window an elf sits with another elf enjoying a drink.

Mely or Melyana is sitting right now, shes six feet even, taller than most elves but not tallest around. Pale skin with a bit of tan on areas that would not be covered by hood or cloak.

Very wild red hair cascading down her back.

Wearing nicer travelers clothes that are worn, this is someone who has realized buying something a little bit more expensive will last better in the long run.

Person on the other side of the table from Mely is someone they've met before. They're not from Jesrala here to enjoy the festival, Ailluin. Sitting across from Mely with a cup of tea in their hands. They're a bit fancy or proper.

> A: I mean the absolute ridiculouslness of what the college is asking me to do. They want me to take on a hundred different students.
> M: Dear I left the college long ago I dont even know runs this anymore, this is typical I'm more concerned that this is a surprise to you. The only way to get less and better students is to move up the hierarchy.
> A: Yes yes I know its not a question of hierarchy for me. I complained that I didn't have enough to do. Putting up with the buearocracy ... its just a, I'm not surprised. Did you hear about the rat army?
> M: I did I was walking around and there were definitely a larger amount of rodants but I'm hearing stories of TIDALWAVES of rodents int he strreets but that is not what I saw.
> A: Tidalwaves? Goodness.
> M: My dear your imagination would do better with some travel.
> A: I've tried its drab filled with seas of rodents.
> M: That seems like exaggeration.

The cafe mutes the noise of the parade outside but its still loud in here.

> A: Well. Less of my garbage, tell me, you mentioned that letter that you had and some sort of magic rune, I'm very curious about it.
> M: Well, I'm not terribly well versed in divinitation.
> *M: Takes out letter from inner pocket of cloak*
> M: I got this from Zahir who is apparnetly working on her capstone. I have studied thaumaturgy for only 100 years and I can barely make anything of this.
> A: I'm sorry did you say Zahir?
> M: Yes Zahir WORDS
> *A: Seems to know the name*
> M: Ail?
> A: Oh you don't know do you.
> M: I travel across the lands and I only stay in a place for like a month!
> A: I'd tell you to sit down but you already are.
> A: Zahir brought their project to the circle, and well she was warned not to do this and was dabbling too far into things she shouldn't have been. Tried to demo the project and well she drew the circle. I assume the one she gave to you and she disappeared.
> M: She disappeared?
> A: Sat down into the circle, channeled some energy the room lit with colors, bright lights and then there was a flash and suddenly Zahir was gone.
> M: Were you there?
> A: Oh yes I was there. 
> M: Was Agrinore there?
> A: Yes saw the whole thing no one really knows what happened they tried to locate her through magical and physical means but no one could. Well... yknow she was warned.
> M: Zahir was ambitious but she was no fool. Something doesn't feel right aboit this Ail.
> A: Ah students have meddled in magic they never should have been she thought somehow she was going to be different. 
> *A: looks back out the window*

In the parade there's a procession of floats and guards marching to the beat of a a drum in front of them. There's a colorguard with dancers on their sides. Calcite is in the middle twirling the flags of Kirkwal and Jresalla. Has a big wide grin on his face and is enjoying his time with it, couldn't be more honored. 

Calcite is going at it twirling the flags all over the place with extra embelishments not in the choreography. The guards are kinda like wtf but the dancers are picking up the energy he's putting down.

They don't have flags just flowy embellished clothing.

> A: Apparently the guards have some sort of heart if they can do that.
> *M: still pensive and processing*
> M: Ailwin was Professor Jathuriel at the circle?
> A: Professor Jathuriel?
> M: My mother dear?
> A: It was an extravaganda but I don't think she was. Why do you think she has something to do with this? Absolutely scandelous.
> M: Ailwin this is my moither. 
> *M: Sip of wine*
> M: Yes. I know and you've been reminding me of that ever since yous aid it the first time.
> A: Its so interesting you weren't there the first time she showed it off.
> M: Yes yes and now she's world renouned for airship engines.
> A: 
> M: I think it was pretty obvious my dear that I didn't have that in me.
> M: You do some wild things at 30 and it puts you on a different path.
> A: My dear I've been doing this for a century now others say I should slow down. You spike one punch bowl and suddenly you're the outcast of the group.
> M: They do need a little social lubrication that doesn't surprise me too much.
> A: That's what I said! Right before they kicked me out.
> A: You should come over to the big gathering tomorrow it's quite a big event I don't know if you've seen it yet it's almost like watching a funeral in motion.
> M: I've seen it.
> A: Oh I know you've seen it but have you ever seen the group that's been chosen.
> M: I actually haven't.
> A: You should see the looks on their faces, half exalted and half look like they're about to walk off a cliff!
> M: Will you be there?
> A: I suppose I could be persuaded. Are you going to be there as well? Or are you heading out of Jresalal
> A: I might make my way

Scene ends with Ailluin donning their cloak and walking out.

Mely sips wine and watches fireworks. 

Crowd tossing stuff to get people to cheer. It's a big thing cause it's the last day as everyone prepares themselves for the tower.

--- 

## The Communion
People go together but do the comunion alone.

In the back of the crowd Calcite is standing with 3 other people.
An elf, a human, and a tiefling.

Calcite was assigned to a group to go to the communion.

Everyone is assigned a town guard to make sure that no one soils the grounds and is safe.

Protect the grounds that [[The Shevet]] vehemently protect.

Overhearing that someone is missing from this group. Seems like there should have been more people in the group its not uncommon for people to back out it can be scary.

I talked to Calcite joining his group. He checked his rulebook. Told him I need to give make something for him after all the gold he keeps slowly giving me.

---

Ailuin  shows up disheveled and smelling of whiskey.

Ailuin slept on the floor of a tavern.

Ailuin lost a bet. Very kept together professor that lost a drinking contest against and ogre and just barely made it up this morning to get to Mely.

Mely prestigititates Ailuin. 

Ailuin has a recommendation about the rune. Has Mely tried to expand it in her mind at the tower? Maybe she can find an answer.

Mely is notably dismissive of the tower.

Ailuin's suggestion seems honest but as if it came from someone else.

Ailuin overheard the idea. No one told him just that he heard rumors that people were talking about a "new magic" with the tower. Rubbish as there's apparently no such thing as new magic.

Ailuin is apparently at times a teatotaler which makes it a bit odd that he smelled of whiskey.

Ailuin seems to be missing something and leaves to go back to the college.

This strikes me the author as very odd behavior. 

Mely says to Ailuin not to bury themselves in work, don't forget to come up for air.

---

Katiz' handler sends a letter with "gathering at the tower huh?" there's a symbol almost a joke at Katiz saying "there's work coming why don't you follow through with this thing and maybe we'll give you more work"

Katiz sighs:
>Fucking pricks

Katiz crumples the note and throws it into the fireplace. Heads towards the tower.

Heads towards the group gathering area.

Katiz looks for a loner that seems scared?

Finds an older man with a wooden braced leg, looks like he's had it for a long time. Standing outside the gathering area looking intently at all the other people as well. Sighing, looking at the floor, not speaking.

Katiz approaches him

> K: You looking to go in the tower?
> *The man jumps*
> M: Ah, yes.

5'11" hunched over with a cane. Face looks like it's been sunbaked like a fieldworker but not too long.

> M: Ah.. yeah I had my son go out to do his tower commune a couple of years ago and well he came back the best I'd ever seen him. He was always so doubtful of himself but he worked on our farm since the frist day he was able to roll the hay barrels but I've never done it myself.
> K: Going to that tower... can certainly give you a new lease on life. BUt not everyone gets the same deal. Are you sure that's something youw ant?
> M: I don't know. I've always lived my life how I figured it would go etc
> M: I don't know I always thought maybe there'd be something more something new. You look familiar do I know you from somewhere?
> K: It's beyond me to tell you how ot live you life. I've seen the best side and the worst side of what this tower can do. But I'll get you there if you really wanna go.
> M: You'll walk an old farm hand off to what might be his possible doom?
> K: Might be walking him towards a better life.
> M: Well shit. Guess some would say I've lived long enough. FUck it why not. I'll go along with ya.
> M: Should we find a group? Should we go ourselves?

Katiz comes up with Troy,

Renry introduces herself at  Calcite's request.

Tieflings spirits are uplifted by Renry being there. Sven is his name.

Gabriella the human and Siren the elf.

---

Announcement happens. Man in green and yellow robe that is the colors of  [[The Shevet]] in noble robes (religious in nature.) Booming voice says
> Everyone please I beg your ears! Welcome to another year at the end of the festival where we all get to experience some greatness that we have so long coveted. Everybody who is about to leave her etoday on that journey will come back better. Everyone who leaves on this journey will leave changed. You will come to understand just why we come together this day of every year to celebrate the greatness that we can seee here just beyond the horizon. 
> *Motiuons beyond to the tower*
> NOW for all who are going to go experience ther greatness that this land has to offer: I bid you good luck and farewell. Everything will be better tomorrow under the towers gaze. 
> Be well.

All the guards usher people to begin the 10 mile walk to the tower.


---

Mely is wandering in on her own. Not avoiding people but not seeking them out either.

Tower is 10K feet tall above the bottom cloud line easily.

ROCK AND STONE

Made of a metal that is both familiar and unfamilar.

Doesn't give off sound or energy. Feels like nothing to it the only thing tha tpeople are getting from it is the experience and clearly people have gotten more from it. 

Katiz did the tower when he was 18. Talks to Troy about it. Troy feels unsure he'll get anything from it. Sits down 

Ask Calcite for his book.

Moat around the tower.

Look at the corner of the river leading to the moat. There's a small shine there.

Water is very cold. Outside is like 60. Has a reddish tint like iron but there's black lines throughout and specs of purple. Not really sure what it is. Six inches across.

--- 

Mely notices something off about the tower. Something about the alignment of it. Almost moving.

Mely goes up to the tower and touches the part that appeared to be moving. It's hard but eventually it actually moves slightly.

A straight line seems to have bowed to the side.

Hand on the letter is now hot.

Mely opens the letter to look at it again.
Rune was drawn in ink. Now the rune is moving. This is not an enchanteed scroll or magic spell. The rune is just now moving.

Where Mely saw the line traced into the tower, where it curved, it flicks back to where it was.

The rune on the letter ignites in Mely's hand.

As it ignites everyone in the vacinity suddenly feels very cold. The air around everyone has become fridgid. The moisture from peoples breath now hangs in the air. Everybody has looked up to see what the hell is going on. 

Prestigdigitates the flame out but it reignites.
Same thing again.

The fire will not stay out it seems to come back hungrier trying to engulf the letter. Mely takes her hand off the tower takes a few steps back and tries to put out the flame again.

Where Mely had seen the line move and snap back the stone begins cracking. The tower has no blemishes it's perfect, it has been perfect. Right as it begins to crach a light eminates from the water a big bright blue light. Everyone starts taking steps away from the water. The letter in Melys hand glows bright blue the fire has gone out but the rune that was on the letter has now embossed itself into the paper. It's part of the paper no longer just a drawing its now in the paper.

Immediately the temperature drops further it becomes like winter. A flash a light that was coming out of the water seems to connect to the crack in the tower. 

---

Feel like we're floating but we're still on the ground in front of the tower.

None of us can see anything. It's black.

---

### Melyana's Dream

Mely smells moisture and salt like the ocean. Opens her eyes and she's thousands of feet in the air looking over an ocean??? in every direction for what seems like 200 miles. The occasional cloud in the sky. But at the very edges of the horizon at her vision she can see what looks like land. But below her just ocean.

She looks down her body is still her shes not falling or floating she is standing. She thinks she could move if she tried.

Wooden desk floating in the air with her. A scribes desk with a singular book, inkwell, and pen.

Book is in celestial. Mely can read "planar" and "chain".

Doesn't look like a language. Or like someone tried to make their own or were insane?

Other part of the it doesn't appear to be a language after Mely casts comprehend languages. As mely picks up the book the cover flies open and the pages flit by at incredible speed seemingly more pages than the book can contain.

Mely sees a vision and has an outer body experience. Sees everything all things and everything that will be as currently is.

Familiar and terrible recognition of being a spectator rather than doing it themselves.

A shadow begins to eclipse her vision and she turns aroudn to see whats blocking the sun. It's a perfect round blackness encompassing her vision then she fades away.

---

### Renry's Dream

Renry feels like the transition was like entering the feywild but its not how it works even when it comes to her in dreams. Sees grass going up and back down up and back down.

Approaches it. In the grass there's a scroll. Doesn't know what it says but does recognize Slyvan in the feywild.

scrolll floats up asn the text beguins shifting and changing. Different languages before she can even read it. Something tells her to take the scroll some voices say "no its forbidden  you can't do this again. You've done this before." Something in her heart compells her to reach out and touch it.

A voice sounds like Titania saying not to touch it. So she doesn't and makes a wisdom saving throw.

Forced to reach out and grab the scroll anyway after failing the wisdom save.

The white void around her changes.

Wind rushes around her face it seems like she's in clouds. The scroll in her hand it pulses with a power as the script stops changing but its still a jumble of chaotic language and burns to ember in her hand. THe energy enters her through her hand and spreads through her body as she raises her arms to the sky. The clouds around her part. Below her is Eleroth. She can see forests towns but not the whole continent. 200 miles of land in each direction.

As her hands raise to the heavens meteors come throught he sky, pieces small pieces, larger planet shattering sizes as they all come down throught he clouds hitting the earth. Hitting villages hitteing forests, water, tidalwaves, fires, explosions. Everything annihilated in this storm of flaming meteors. She can help but smile at it as she blacks out once more.

---

### Katiz' Dream

Katiz wakes up in a dense forest. It is freezing cold here. He has no idea where he is this is a forest he's never seen in his life. It's unnatural bent into shapes that shouldn't exist. THe foiliage is red brown yellow with green mist in. He walks around and investigates. He feels like he's only been walking for a few minutes but it physically feels like he's been walking for hours.

Katiz is now exhausted. He crosses a treeline in front of him in desert as far out as he can see. It is now blazing hot here it is unbearable. It feels like he's walked into an oven, a kiln. It... this shouldn't be here this forest shouldn't be this close to the desert.

He feels like he can't walk anymore until snow begins to fall. Falling on the sand. A blizzard appears out of nowhere covering his eyes. He opens them again is on a mountain. It's back to freezing cold again. But the mountains aroudn him they don't look right either. They zigzag aroudn the earth like there's openings in the crust of the planet. 

4 points of exhaustion. 

He takes a step through the snow trying as hard is he can. This is so unnatural that he's terrified. THis can't exist but he's here experiencing it. As he takes steps forward he trips and falls into the snow. But not into... through he keeps falling until he hits water. Crashes into it and its pitch black.

Becomes nearly impossible to stay in the water. Before the water crests his neck he swears he can hear a voice calling out. Like someone you know. It just says "dad?" as the water takes him. Fades out.

---
### [[Breda]]'s Dream

Im in an orchard with rows of trees perfectly organized. theyre made of copper and gold and silver and iron. theyre decorated with these bright red and green leaves and colorful fruits. theyre beatiful.

I cut into the metal? fruit. Its sweet and tangy delicious.

get dragged into the sky after hearing a voice say "you stray to far my child"

I got zucked into the sky?

Sky is green
Sky goes over and under the horizon

Area I was standing was a floating circle mountains.

---

### Calcite's Dream

Calcite wakes up at a peaceful ancient temple.

Stone pillars keeping the ceiling up. Sun comes through in radiant beams. Like breazes. peaceful Shaking trees sounds .

It's a nice place to be.

At the end of the temple there's a stone archway. Vines come from the walls wrapped around the archway keeping it in place.

> Wait a minute I know what this is I'm dream walking. 

Calcite closes his eyes and tries to fly.

For a moment it felt like he was starting to float like all his weight was gone.

>Guess I need to go to wizard school for that.

Calcite checks for his book.

>There's nothign in the rules about this...

He approaches the arch which has a faint blue glow coming from the inside portion of the arch. He didn't even notice it until he started walking closer to it.

The more he does the more it feels like there's something there but there isn't anythign visually.

There's just stone wall on the other side of it like more of the temple.

As he walks throught he arch it feels like walking through a silken curtain. You'd think you could be on the other side and be ok as he does his vision disolves and changes before his eyes. He's suddenly looking at the sky. Walls on both sides at the very edge of where the stone circle ends there's a golden dragon born standing next to an adult silver dragon. They're looking out over the edge and as he comes in they both seem to perk up. They turn to look at him. There's a dragonborn wearing very fanciful robes that look like the came from some wizarding school. Like some headmaster sort of deal.

It's clear from the robes that the person isn't just about status but there's something substantial about them.

A voice in Calcites head says "who are you you shouldn't be here"

right before Calcite is pulled back through the arch losing his vision in much the same was as before but loses vision.

---

We all wake up at the base of the tower all prone.

There is a crack in the great tower now. The blue light.

Letter isn't there, the rune is because it's now part of Mely's hand.

Closes left hand into fist gently and walks up to the tower to look at the crack.

Not large enought to reach into but now a fog is coming out.

Only the party seems to have woken up. Takes a sample into a bottle from the alchemists supplies. 

**You've got a bottle of fog!**

The fog that washes over people starting to vanish them. Not that they dissolve but sort of disappear. Kind of covering them and lowers everyones visibility.

Mely touches the tower and her hand burns. Suddenly away from the tower there's a dark humanoid shape then a smaller shape and another smaller shape and something seems like it's coming closer.
