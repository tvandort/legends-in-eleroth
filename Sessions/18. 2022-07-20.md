Gang of 3 goes to try to get Ashren while Breda prepares for the next day.

Use pass to get to ask for Ashren who comes out and leers at the group with bed head.

Mely tries to warn Ashren. 

Ashren brings them inside and unlocks some office magically by waving her hand over it.

Says they can speak there candidly.

Ashren isn't really buying it.

Mely claims spell was cast on her. Ashren does Detect Magic to check.

Katiz and Mely notice that Ashren seems to be suspiciously looking around? Oh apparently she's seen this sort of thing before. Keeping a very close eye on them. Shes becoming more suspicious because this is then n-th time we've brough this up to her.

Ashren sure is confident they would have found contraband when a group of 4 chumps just snuck in a pretty powerful bit of contraband.

Ashren offers to do detect thoughts on them. Oh fucking boy here we go.

IT'S RENRY GOODNESS GRACIOUS.

The detect thoughts starts happening. Here's how we die fam.

There's some scary chaos shit happening in Renry's head what the fuck. 

Saw an apocalpyse sort of thing apparently? Oh it was the vision OK. Had forgotten.

Ashren says to get out.

Ashren seems completely shell shocked.

Katiz gives Ashren the potion of hydration and leaves.

Ashren waves her hand and the wooden door slams behind her.

I can't believe they're all alive and relatively unmolested.

Ye Olde Whistle more empty than usual.

They check in with Urgle.
