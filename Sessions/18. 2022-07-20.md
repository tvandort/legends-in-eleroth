Gang of 3 goes to try to get Ashren while Breda prepares for the next day.

Use pass to get to ask for Ashren who comes out and leers at the group with bed head.

Mely tries to warn Ashren. 

Ashren brings them inside and unlocks some office magically by waving her hand over it.

Says they can speak there candidly.

Ashren isn't really buying it.

Mely claims spell was cast on her. Ashren does Detect Magic to check.

Katiz and Mely notice that Ashren seems to be suspiciously looking around? Oh apparently she's seen this sort of thing before. Keeping a very close eye on them. Shes becoming more suspicious because this is then n-th time we've brough this up to her.

Ashren sure is confident they would have found contraband when a group of 4 chumps just snuck in a pretty powerful bit of contraband.

Ashren offers to do detect thoughts on them. Oh fucking boy here we go.

IT'S RENRY GOODNESS GRACIOUS.

The detect thoughts starts happening. Here's how we die fam.

There's some scary chaos shit happening in Renry's head what the fuck. 

Saw an apocalpyse sort of thing apparently? Oh it was the vision OK. Had forgotten.

Ashren says to get out.

Ashren seems completely shell shocked.

Katiz gives Ashren the potion of hydration and leaves.

Ashren waves her hand and the wooden door slams behind her.

I can't believe they're all alive and relatively unmolested.

Ye Olde Whistle more empty than usual.

They check in with Urgle.

Breda makes gift. Writes letters. Applies Blessing of the Forge to armor. Spends 15 minutes medidating to prep spell list. Sends letters. Gets gift box for cat gift.

---

Katiz goes to get a bruiseball to autograph for the princess.

A bruiseball is a knotted rope ball of rough spikey rope.

Like really pointy velcro.

---

Mely goes to buy spell components.

---

Renry asks for a shield that has flowers and plants wreathing it and a mouse turd trail leading to the mouse.

Go to Balhrus' shop to make shield, show off a bit to make friends, and fix the splint armor up.

All the nice places for clothes are closed. Might be a store in the square with nicer clothes. Looks like a bodega??????

Run down super aged warforged

Witness the Fashion

The name of the warforged is witness

Get some weird abomination of a dress. Breda is not pleased but also isn't expecting to keep this on very long and its a throwover soooo normal clothes underneath.

Renry gets something like a Qipao but cheap.

Mely just gets jewlery after she changes the thread color on her clothes.

Katiz gets a really nice jacket! With a bunch of blood inside.

Mely actually gets a nice dress for really cheap by just waiting because that's apparently how negotiating with Witness goes.

Renry gets a hat for the mouse.

Katiz asks for magic items. Witness asks if we're cops. He says no to magic items. Katiz bribes him with 2 gold. Mely sees an illusion on the wall that Witness glanced off at. Apparently he sometimes does have magic items wtf lol.

Witness' arm turns into a crossbow. Aims it at Mely.

Breda leaves because like uh if the shopkeep pulls a gun on you its time to get going. Especially when the person you're with seems to be fixing to start a brawl with the shopkeep.

The place might be lead lined????? what the fuck lol.

---

Mely isn't happy that we walked out lol, welp.
