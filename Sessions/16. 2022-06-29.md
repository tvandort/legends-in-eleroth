Gabrielle's Baker is Cook.

Gabrielle took an offer from the Academy to learn in Ghor Alari because no one was accepting her into any research positions.

There's a hidden path below the castle that goes to an unassuming tunnel, possibly dug by some servants. Maybe bandits, whatev. End of the tunnel there'd be an exit. But there's a beautiful cerulean door with an unknown language.

No one knows how to open the door. People tried to dig around it and there's nothing there on the other side.

Door has two pillars on the sides. The door has a seam in the middle. Has ornate decorative style. Whole door is very blue. Iconography of waves and clouds and water. There's a script on it wrapped around in a circle on the middle. Katiz recognizes some of the symbols it almost looks celestial but not all of the letters.

Mely recognizes it from tower dream. Looks like proto celestial like it has some primordial in it.

Monty family books on second floor.

Most of the tower books talk about doing experiments on the tower itself.

No one is really watching us, we're off in a corner somewhere.

Baker does magically show up places. Might be tracking the bruiseball necklace that Katiz has on.

Breda makes a non-enchanted copy of the key before the group gives it to Gabrielle.

Overlook is the inn. Bout 5 gold per room for a night. 20 minute walk.

West: Ye olde whistle 1 gold. 40 minutes.

East: Chubby Shirt hole in the wall 5 silver.

Gilded childs toy, starts at noon.

Wistle is bigger than standard tavern inn. Bunch of trades people and crafts people nearby. 4 stories tall with you walk inside the whole bottom floor is open and huge.

Katiz creates a big comotion by being a sportsman. The sports enthusiants are very funny. Drawing a bit too much attention. Guards are bringing Katiz to guard house with workout equipment.

Convince the guards to let us know if weird shit is going on in the during the party after impressing them with credentials and lifting large things and putting them down.

These guards are fucking hilarous lol.

Ashren is not happy with us lol.
