Katiz continues to look for Baker

Maybe Baker will just show up.

Katiz is not being subtle.

stranger comes up to ask him for an autograph lmao.

someone tries to put something into Katiz's pocket

nope its a fucking kid LOL

katiz rolls with it and puts him up on his shoulders

kid did pickpocket him though haha.

> K: Buy yourself something nice kid.

Katiz tries to crowd surf the kid but instead fucking chucks him too far 

two people fumble the kid to the ground

> K: That's a future bruiseball player guaranteed!

People don't buy it and disperse.

Baker shows up.

He looks smug.

they trade some really well placed barbs back and forth but I think Baker has the upper hand here.

Has a job about the royal family.

bring a package there.

katiz nat 20 trips Baker on the way out. Katiz now clearly has the upper hand.


breda argues with the nurse who is very not interested in trying to figure out how bad it is.

turns out that geas is the spell that is cast on Jayce.

tell nurse.

another cleric shows up to deal with it who is a halfling.

we talk to the guard and try to figure out wtf Lahrann is up to.

split up gold. 

calcite gives mely a bunch of gold cause he has a job

mely goes to get materials to scribe into spellbook for catapult.

the party goes to see naomi to see if the list has any issues.

calcite mentions the  legend of the dwarven metal horse (trojan horse lol nice)

the list has an entry on the bottom that seems off maybe

theres a big gift along with the flower arrangements.

10 arboreal sprouts

breda tells Renry not to mention the tower cause of the mind wipe police.

we suspect something may have been done to the 10 arboreal sprouts

head that way with naomi

area starts going from homes into sheds around here:
