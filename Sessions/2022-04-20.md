Katiz tells Renry about the child throwing. Asks her to spread a rumor that that was a Katiz imposter because he relies on money from convention circuits to make a living.

Head towards Horticulture academy the wall wraps around that too and there are guards on the wall.

Guards watch us approach but don't really say anything yet.

Nice flowers and arches lots of colors leading up towards the door.

Student appears to be coming through. We walk through the entryway its a long unassuming hallway that leads to a desk where a man is sitting at the counter.

He's wearing a suit as opposed to the robe the student was wearing.

Calcite introduces us to a person at a desk. Says we're here to question him lol.

Calcite gets the impression that the guy we're talking to is reacting genuinely but that there's a hint of something underneath it.

Guy (Gustav) goes off to talk to acquisitions. Somehow this guy doesn't know about Jayce being missing which tbh is "huh?" apparently he doesn't vote the fucking clod. 

Calcite asks to go with.

Calcite deputizes Renry as the leader while he's gone. He said that Katiz seemed to be breathing heavy on his way here and for her to keep an eye on him since he's past his prime.

Mely is looking for a student who looks like with their shit together.

Two doors behind desk. Guy takes Calcite with him to talk to someone.

Lady that he's brought to seems to be more aware of this than one would expect.  Might have been mind wiped? Nah maybe just charmed.

The arboreal sprouts are missing. Looks confused that she gave them over.

Calcite kind of checks them by saying the plants were made to explode they seem surprised.

Lady was a half elf named renna.

Naomi still getting shit done. Looks stressed out.

Katiz, Renry, and Breda go back to the inn. We can hear the fight pit going.

Caim and Zasheda are sat at a table.

Zasheda had a similar dream to the one Breda had and mentioned that other cleric sorts had been having similar dreams but themed for the gods they follow. Her's is Lathandar.

Also Zasheda and Ostorum are siblings.

Katiz and Renry go for drinks. Renry tries to spread rumors for Katiz.

Calcite is suspicious of Renry probably because of the animal freeing thing.

---

Go to sleep. Wake up next day and it's very foggy.

Mely, Breda downstairs.

Renry and Calcite have a weird ass conversation about how Calcite thinks he's racist but he's really just probably suspicious about Renry being like a chaos person.

They weirdly laugh together and wake Katiz up like an alarm clock.

---

We see someone kind of raiding a cart? Calcite calls out to him and he runs.

Katiz and Calcite go after him, Calcite action surge dashes and zooms towards whoever this is.

He's confused as to why he's been tackled and manacled.

Breda and Mely check the cart. There are crates that are nailed shut. Footlocker chest 4'wide 3'deep. Big padlock. There's a couple of round sacks that are tied closed with rope.

Nothing particular of note.

Katiz introduces himself as the bruiseball man.

The tackled person is Alan the person we're looking for.

Blonde (10 outta 10 apparently) half elf enchanted him. (I suspect Lahrahn has a disguised form.) Gave him 50 gold and a good promise.

Hoo boy lots of talk about investigating some not so suspicious seeming stuff.

Calcite brings Alan to a guard house. And talks to Alan about if he's racist and doesn't get why someone might be afraid of a guard.

He looks at Calcite terrified and Calcite does not like that. Starts to soften up and just asks some normal questions about any info the guy might how about the mystery person who had the arboreal saplings.

Calcite lets him go. Alan is confused. Calcite says just cause someones suspicious doesn't mean you have to chase them lol.

Calcite leaves, Alan stands there dumbfounded. Starts running away.

Breda breaks open the lock on Alan's chest for Renry and Kalcite for some reason.
