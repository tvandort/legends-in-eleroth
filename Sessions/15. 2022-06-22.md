Mely asks some questions about the brumstone.
Katiz asks some questions about weird magic from the map. Randos know nothing about this.
Breda gives Renry the lockpick set. Renry tries to pick a random rooms lock.
Renry succeeds and then messes up the bed and puts a mouse poop on the pillow.
Renry then decides to make the beds for some reason and just leave the mouse poop?
Mental smell of a warm breeze enters Renry's mind. This means Titania is happy?

Sell some bullshit mostly leathers. Keep the metal to sell.

Brumstone island hasn't been around too long. 10 years ago it was brought here into the city and they lifted the ground up. From people talking about it Mely learns that the little castle on top is a research center. Bloomigan Conservatory.

Have to stake a claim that you belong to Conservatory to research there.

Mely attempting to get in.

Katiz attempts to get info about weird magic from a nerd. The nerd is definitely a fedora wearer (great voice tho). Um achtuallied Katiz, Katiz smacks the books out of the nerds hand, kicks dust on them wiley e. cayote style. Then says his name is Mely.


Large walls surround Gor Alari. Tall buildings rise from behind those walls even from as far out as we are. Spires on some of the towers. Getting to the gate there's a long line of carts and people waiting to go through the checkpoint to get into the city.

Monty family birthday is tomorrow.

Guards are being really thorough with searches. Ooops.

Mely demands to see guard captain. He comes out. Doesn't really care about Bloomenfeld letter. Sees the Jesralan one and is like "whoa" hands us back the Jesralan scroll.

"let them through" -- with no other comment

---

First thing we notice is that we're on this long road, 30 feet from sidewalk to sidewalk. People coming and going on both sides of the road. Lots of hustle and bustle.

It's the capital city of the country and this is very recognizable to Mely and Breda. Similar to cities they're familiar with.

Each building is at least 3 stories high. Business street level homes on top.

Amount and size of buildings around us is something.

Hair shenanigans happen.

The mouse may be smarter than it apears.

---

Pass by an inn. An academic building. People walking around with books. General structure reminds Mely of a school. We hit another fork but the castle looms large in the distance. Castle is huge. Guards at this bridge.

Colosseum is really noticable.

Mely knows that another church looking building is the royal academy.

Carts and stuff are much nicer here. We kinda stick out. 

Breda notices the tower by the bridge has an outlook inside of a slitted window looking down at everyone.

Underneath the bridge there are spike sthat look like they can move.

Breda notices that everyone is staring at us. The person in the slitted window walks away.

Inside the castle grounds there are a bunch of people walking around doing maintenance on walls. Platoons doing drills. Couple of people in aristocrat robes talking in hushed voices.

As we get through the gates another guard that's inside says "wait here please".

After a few minutes of waiting another half elf woman appears out of the gates in front of us. That looks like it would come from the castle proper.

Ashren Quellen greets us.

Flash of white over Ashren Quellen's eyes. Break open the wax, unfurl it. Looks at us questioningly while she reads it. 

> Fucking Zedall.

Fucking lol more like it.

> You appear to be here on a knowledge gathering journey. The person who sent you here likely

Zedall doesn't know much. Thinks what we're looking for is mystery and legends. Very dismissive. Hands metal medallion to Mely. Its an insignia of the royal family.

If we need anything talk to Ashren. Don't just randomly talk to anyone, have to arrange it through Ashren. Doesn't want us wandering around the castle. We only got as far as we did cause of the letter.

Mely shows her Bloomenfeld letter detailing us helping the delivery of the birthday bullshit. 

Medallion has very deep intricate designs. And is enchanted so Breda can't copy it boo.

Library is a beautifully decorated building. Marbled floors etc.

Very large center desk. Female gnome helps us when we get to the desk. Katiz says he's looking for a Gabriella Erlinger.

Mely flashes the medallion.

Help goes off to get Gabriella.

People are excited about books.

Place is incredibly magical.

Gnome comes back. Gabriella said she was very busy asks if we could go to her.

She's back in the library in a direction the gnome shall guide us.

Building is like floor to ceiling bookshelves. This makes me nervous quite frankly. This is a lot of info to ruin if Lahrahnn wanted to. (Or I guess Renry but I hope not lol.)

Mage hands are flying around picking books up and stuff. Quill pens and papers flying taking notes etc.

In a big comfy chair a dark skinned woman sits. Tight clothing shawl around her shoulders. She's wearing tons of jewlery, a bunch of piercings per ear. Jewlery on only her left hand.

Gnome's name was Jasmine. 

I don't know what to write for what just happened.

Katiz mentions Baker and the group he works for. Gabrielle looks shifty immediately.

Gabrielle casts zone of truth. And Private Sanctum.

Doesn't want to be working for the Academics people. Had Katiz do bloody work in the past.

Everything is a secret. Each person has their own Baker. Their own informant. She isn't contacted often. She is simply at the library to learn as much as she can under the nose of royalty. She wants out.
