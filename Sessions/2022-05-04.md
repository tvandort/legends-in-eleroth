Chauntea is a god that the folks in Bloomenfeld worship.

[[Robert Barton]] gives us potions and we tell him about whatever the fuck is going on in the forest.

Robert is writing us another letter of passage sort of thing

We learn about the Copperbottoms.

They found Calcite.

He doesn't remember much.

They said he had 

Renry doesn't remember anything prior to being 12 years old.

Reup on rations. 

Calcite and Breda talk about armor and wages and when Calcite's might show up.

Renry and Katiz plan on laying in the flower field.

Meylana goes to visit Naomi.

Katiz asks Renry for help after almost forgetting to follow up with Baker.

Baker doesn't seem to be showing up.

Someone in the window of a building is staring at Katiz.

Renry keeps picking up bullshit. Bottlecap. Finds a random fucking ring and notices Katiz walking off towards building with person in it.

Renry makes a Renry check for that btw.

Then Renry makes a wis save for ideas? Then disguises herself and goes to building.

Dust on stuff. Months of buildup.

Even in the dim light Katiz sees Baker.

Delivery is too [[Gabriella Eirlinger]] works at library in castle Monty.

It's a secret.

Checkpoints heading towards Gor Alari.

Security is tighter cause of festival.

Package is magic. They're gonna detect it. Keep it secret keep it safe. Will be an upgrade for Katiz's reputation.

Renry goes up in disguise and pretends to be someone doing an census.

Baker and Katiz sneak around while Renry knocks on the door repeatedly, holy shit lol.

Katiz shoes (shoos? shus? shous?) Renry disguised as the census taker off.

Baker is like "who followed you i dont want to put up with this shit"

they leave

---

Katiz and Renry meet up again after whatever the fuck that was lmao.

---

Melyana goes to the Wizened Owl.

Storekeeper has a vial of orange smokey something inside. It's a party trick? Potion of firebreathing. Holy shit that's a dangerous party trick lmao.

also has scrolls of create food and water, levitate. Mely ain't biting.

Asks for sending stones. But I bet they're fucking expensive. 250g! (wow that's cheap goddam.)

Book on transmutation. Mely ain't going for that either.

---

Renry and Katiz have another weird conversation and then buy crowns.

---

Katiz asks us to look around then shows a bronze key.

Key is glowing with conjuration magic. Brightly. 

Mely can tell that there's a spell put onto the key. It's not a created magic item. It's something beyond Mely. It seems like Mely has no knowledge of something of this calibur. 

Tells us.

Katiz asks Mely if she knows who [[Gabriella Eirlinger]] is.

Mely hasn't met [[Gabriella Eirlinger]] , Katiz is looking for an intro.

Robert gave us a writ of passage. Make it easier to get through checkpoints and shit.

Mely mentions to the group that she tracked down a set of sending stones. But they were 250g which is expensive but still really cheap.

---

forests wane in their density eventually becoming wetlands. we see some resevourioiouiouoiurs. fuck that word.

Land becomes flatter and move paved. Before they could get away with dirt and a bit of brick. Paving prevents cart travel issues.

---

Breda identifies the key she's hit wiht a powerful shudder. something that shes never heard of or experienced.

This is whoa level dangerous. The demiplane spell. 

Katiz tells us he's working for The Academics to help his son who was hurt by the tower.

They are part of the Utherian academy but it's like a group of people who are skunkworksing it.

Katiz sheds a tear. His son knew that he went to the tower at one point in his life. He was never an althetic type but he thought it could be something they could share. So he went to the tower and it changed him.

He took on magic that was too much for him. He tried to claw his eyes out all the mages could say was there was something he remembered but they do not know what. 

Was screaming that there was something that the tower taught him and that he couldn't find it.

Katiz describes Baker to the group. Baker  "shows himself" (that's intereting). Sallow guant face. Short brown hair. Pale white skin. Usually dresses himself as homeless or a bum. He has blue eyes. 

Mely convinced Renry to learn reading and math.

Off to the right in the fog we start seeing small flecks of light. The more everyone focuses on it. After noticing it at nearly the same time.

We see sparks and hear kind of arcing,. The ground begins to rumble. Out of the fog comes a large rock beast and a gust of wind that brushes past everyone. Enough that we have to sheild ourselves from it.

Next to the rock beast is a swirl of air. Both covered in chains. Behind them is a giant ninefoot tall 12 foot long wooden wagon that they're attached to.

Comes out of the fog towards the road on an intercept course.

Our horses rear up and stop.

There's a persron at the top with a big hood up. Reach into their pocket and something attached to a gold chain. They flip it open and look at it.

In this whispish(?) voice call out and say 

> Hello travelers can someone tell me which plane I'm on
