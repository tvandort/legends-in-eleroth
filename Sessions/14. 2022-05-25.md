After seeing Calcite rush off BReda pauses to think. Shit should we maybe involve the guards.

She thinks better of it and runs off to find Calcite.

He's just missing now.

Calcite is just missing. Katiz and Breda look for Calcite can't find him.

Renry feels the feywild or something with no communication.

Calcite may have gone home, apparently, sometimes that happens.

Renry continues to get Calcite may have gone to the Fey not in danger. Maybe? Tries to brain talk to Calcite or Titania. Tries to send the ring to Calcite. 

Yeah he fell through a gate into the Fey.

Took about an hour but everyone minus Calcite shows up at the cart.

Get on the road with Renry and Katiz driving. 

Katiz hears a thudding sound briefly.

Breda makes a lead box for Katiz's key.

Almost run someone over. Lurch to a stop. 

Thudding sound was an axe. Tree smashes into road.

Apparently the captain was sebastian houghton.

Smaller than bloomenfeld.

Looks like theres a big mound of dirt floating in the air.

Floating island with blue specks around it.

Is this brumstone? Yes. It is not common here. It's a miracle of arcana engineering.

Minicastle on top of the mound is this thing giving off light.

Returning captain of bandits to guard house.
