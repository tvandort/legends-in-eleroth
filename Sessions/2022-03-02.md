Amira Monty is a little girl?

Discuss what we're gonna be doing.

Talking about home and traveling.

It'll take 1-2 weeks to get to Ghor Alari.

Calcite and Renry go to the captain.

They're giving us 2 horses, a cart, and 1 weeks rations.

Expect us to leave tomorrow morning. 

Renry talks to Shuli a half orc receptionist who claims that we're in trouble and that she has juicy gossip.

Shuli claims to have mind wiped a political prisoner a long time ago.

After trying to charm Shuli, Renry paid her off.  Turns out the Shevet were planning on memory wiping us if we didn't agree. Might still anyway? But the mind wipe isn't very fun.

Renry and Melyana gave Shuli some info for the gold back. 

Mention of [[Zidall]] scares Shuli into non-interest.

Cart will be at the barracks at the East Gate.

Torch and the Halberd
Thirsty Lizard is on the other side of the town.
Fools Jester is a dive bar there
 
Late afternoon

[[Breda]] is at an inn with a lot of other merchants. Golden quest hotel. (think con hotel)
Melyana was at the emerald spa hotel. Helped out by an old friend Corinn
Katiz was crashing on a couch

Calcite writes and sends a letter to his captain Fannon Colfoot a dwarf.

The Torch and the Halberd
2 man band, male elf, female human are playing music in the corner and a bunch of people dancing around them.

Back of the room has a stairs to a loft.

Very crowded.

Minataur behind the counter serving drinks. Seems like a good bartender.

Everyone in the tavern appears on the younger side.

Barmanataur (nice lol)

Melyana communed with the tower when she was 30. Lost some memory from that time (missed the comment)

Renry lost her memory entirely it seems.

Calcite runs into Lovelace a bearded dwarven women, Lovelace. Tells her he's going on an adventure.

Asks her if folks were acting unusual after the tower.

Katiz is known as "the big kat" and was one of the best defenders in [[bruiseball]].

Calcite has been protecting the brothels.

Lovelace is smooth af.

Katiz takes a one whipe wonder.

Melyana goes for a massage.
Renry teaches Calcite how to dance.

---

[[Breda]] talked to Bryce about him taking the shop for a little while she goes on this job for the Shevet. Also told him info but told him not to tell anyone. They go and have a drink together before [[Breda]] turns in.

---

Renry and Calcite drink and dance the rest of the night. Renry drinks to much and is taken back to the House of Pleasure by Calcite cause she does not have a room. Many floors, Renry accidentally falls asleep on Calcites cott. 

Someone looks in on them, Renry notices but her face seems to shimmer like a faun sort of face?

---

We all kind of have dreams about our earlier vision experiences. 

---

Renry wakes up on a patch of grass in a humid location. It's foggy, there are big gigantic columns of redwood trees that trace the lining of the horizon in every direction.

It feels strange to her but at the same time it's comforting. The only place that really has nature that looks like this is familiar to her, it's the feywild.

On the back of a very large ibex is Titania. She is sitting casually on it's back as it guides itself towards Renry. 

Titania wakes Renry up and greets Titania. Titania asks for a better greeting, Renry is bonked for her impudence.

Titania asks about what Renry saw at the tower.

Renry tells Titania about Lahrann. 

Titania asks for more info. 

Titania is concerned about whatever it is that Renry saw and asks Renry to look into it for her. 

Titania says to follow the woman we're looking to find I think to see if she can glean anything.

Titania then kicks Renry out of her dream to wakefulness.

Found out detail wise that the shop hasn't been doing great.
