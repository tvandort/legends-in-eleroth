Heading to Gorfelno to find girl of the monty royal family.

[[Melyana]] looks for info about what happened in the morning but doesn't really find anything.

[[Breda]] mails off ore to Fianna.

[[Calcite]] goes for a run.

Recieved Note of Passage for Ghor Alari castles.

---

[[Katiz]] looks for traps in the cart / supplies and [[Calcite]] looks for sugar cubes.

 After not understanding horses [[Katiz]] finally gets up and gets the cart going.

---

Grasslands for most of the journey until we hit forests. The road is well manacured.

Travel for most of the day after stopping at a waypoint to buy more sugar cubes.

sugar cube count: 26

---

Set up camp for the night. [[Melyana]] lights the fire.

---

[[Katiz]] and [[Calcite]] talk on the first watch.
[[Calcite]] asks [[Katiz]] if he misses [[bruiseball]]. [[Katiz]] does sometimes but priorities change y'know.

[[Calcite]] would pick things up and put them down instead of being a guard.

[[Melyana]] takes over watch. Fog rolls in. [[Melyana]] thinks about if its weird fog again.

---

Had nice breakfast with fresh eggs, salted meat, fresh bread.

3 or 4 pm we get to a thicker forest. its more dense but still well kept.

Ask a couple traveling by for a map cause somehow [[the Shevet]] didn't bother to give us one.

Marjory and ??? gave us a map. They seemed like traders and said they knew the route well. 

Map says not to go to ghorfelno in summer lol.

[[Renry]] spends her time making fart sounds happen when 2 people are passing by trying to make them argue lol.

As we get closer to the city the treeline gets further from the road.
In the distance we can see gorgeous colors. Blumenfeld is a test field for herbs and other sorts of plants.

Every city in Ghor'Felno specializes in some sort of agriculture.

Pride themselves on being the first major road into Ghor'Felno

The city you can smell before you see from lavender bushes and all sorts of floral scents.

Guard stops us comes up to the side and looks up at [[Katiz]]. Cart inspection happens. An inspector tries to take some jerky but [[Melyana]] calls him out and he puts it back. [[Renry]] makes it sound like he farted.

Naomi Griffith is a decendent of the family who owns the tulip field that [[melyana]] slept in that created the rule that people aren't allowed to sleep in the tulip fields.

Gentle pony fighting pit.

---

[[Melyana]] looks for the Griffith's they aren't home. Asks neighbor. They might be in the fields.

---

Rest of us make our way to the Gentle Pony.

Bartender says the fight pit is later. We order some thunderkeg. Big stone ring with a bunch of blacksmiths they sometimes put on shows or take requests.
