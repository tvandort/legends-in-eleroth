PIllows, bedroll, jacks.

Renry is probably missing something Andrew wrinked his nose on the 19. What would we have found on the 20. The world may never know.

Renry steals the jacks after Breda catches her at it.


Head to tree. There's a bunch of movement pass the two guards at the gate. They seem to have heeded our warning.

As we get closer to the forest we can see that something withering is spreading outwards from that cursed tree maybe.

Guard just lets us through.

Leaves crunch beneath our feet like its the middle of winter.

Damp bark crumbling like charcoal.

Seems like the plant death is extraplanar (according to Mely's arcana check.)

2 guards look dismayed. They have green spray on their armor. Ah yes cyanolymph.

There may be holy people at the chruch that might know what's going on.

Large church in Hotheath, look for Prior Salvatore.

Get back to big webbed area.

Breda and Katiz see splatters of red across the forest floor around here, probably from our prior battle. Webs are annoying to get through but mostly cleaved our way through.

The tree that was in that clearing was very wide. It was crumbling before now it looks dessicated. 

Mely leaves a handprint as if in mud on the tree. Mely hand hurt. Mely look at hand.

One circle on the tattoo looks darker than the rest. Darker than Black maybe even. Oh wait it was like a henna tat but the colors seem to be washing out actually.

Doesn't seem biological.

Everything is all slightly magic around. Seems celestial?

This is gonna tank the economy. 

Breda gets convinced to identify the deading tree.

Renry kinda goes to some mind place in the meantime by laying on the grass.

Titania is in Renry's imagination on a Ibex. Titania is surprised by the arrival of Renry.

Titania says that Lahrann. Renry doesn't know who Lahrann is she thinks it's Lolth. The fuck? Lol.

Lahrann plants Renry down for being a shit lol.

People ask Renry if she's OK.

She tries to cast mage hand?

Renry says that this magic is beyond Lahrann. Says its not a mortal realm thing with some weird word like tronced.

Renry launches into a chat with folks that don't include Breda about Titania then has to retcon it because ofc Renry doesn't know her own character details.

The tree had no information from Identify which is completely unsurprising.

Katiz flying kicks the tree and it turns into sand.

Mely's hand shoots pain to her like chest like being electrocuted.

The tattoo is now glowing then it goes away.

Breda, Renry, and Katiz large boulder where the path ends. 

Someone dug beneath the boulder. There's a hole with a note in it. Calcite grabs note.

> Be more adventurous next time.
> - L

Nothing in the dust pile that used to be a tree. Doesn't hurt Mely anymore.

The magical blight thing is spreading.

We go back to Jayce. He startles then says "ah my heroes" weirdly. Finger is not reattached.

Jayce was forcibly coerced by Lahrann.

Jayce asks nurse to leave infirmary. Apologizes didn't want to do what he did.

Jayce says has a lot to catch up on, after Renry asks him about what he remembers of the tree and what it looks like now.

Jayce doesn't seem like he knows much of anything but like self aggrandizing assholes usually don't know shit so this checks out.

They find out Jayce did in fact talk to a hot blonde after telling him he wouldn't feel pain under a Geas.

Renry asks the nurse about whether she liked the cool fake 1 minute flower.

The nurse likes wine.

Information was relayed about the new character with a name, that I didn't catch the spelling of.
