Renry tries to get a dude to do her research for her.

Renry uses the power of boobs to convince a unkempt nerd to help her. Nerd is Cornelius. Renry is Jessebel Melanthra (????) (from Bloomenfeld) 

Demon web pits in the abyss is where Lolth lives or something. Finds the shape of the logo on Lahrahnn's chest plate.

Yochlol do the dirty work for Lolth. Perhaps Lahrahn is one of these because they can be shapeshifters. They're really convincing.

Renry has the book of The Extraplanar Gods about 500 pages.

Nevermind she gave it to Mely lol.

Walk into tavern.

Very loud in the tavern.

Renry is playing bones with some people. There's like 15 people behind Renry.

Tradespeople are still going.

Katiz and Breda go up to bar, it's circular. There are 3 bar tenders.

Bartender recognizes Katiz. One of his legs is a wooden prosthetic. He played some ball for a while but now doesn't cause of that.

We bounce outta that conversation.

Big dude sits down to play bones with Renry.

1, 5, or 3 of a kind to keep going.

Big dude is 1d6 short of a bones game, like personally not for the game.

Renry starts being a bone shark.

1 gold bet.
Renry continues.
Big dude continues.
Bets again.
Big dude continues.
Renry continues.
Bets again Big dude goes all in.
Renry still in.
Big dude loses. 
Slams table and cracks something then throws chair hard enough to hit the guy behind him.

Renry told Katiz and Breda to call her Jessebel.

Some stranger approaches Renry and Katiz and asks to join them. Why does this feel sus.

She pulls down hood and reveals ears similar to Melyana. Gold hair. Her face looks perfect.

Wearing a drab cloak.

Asks to bet 10 gold, pulls out a platinum piece.

Rando rolls really well. Puts down 5 plat after Renry also rolls really well.

Same as above. Rando puts down two coils stacked on top of each other. The top one is plat the one underneath is something else.

There's a silver colored coin with a red gem in the center. Dildo betting occurs.

Lahrann is trading barbs back and forth with Renry and Katiz. Air is heavier near her and people are silent around them. All look like small animals trying to hide from something in a way.

Renry is straight up negging Lahrann and said that Mely and Breda were off having an triste(sp?) somewhere?

Lahrann is complaining about the loss of her gift of the twig blights.

Lahrann likes messing with us, for her its a game within a game. She likes watching our gears turn. 

Lahrann does some mass suggestion style casting on the crowd nearby and then says "why would you try to assassinate a 12 year old girl."

The crowd turns like 40 people.

Lol initiative time. Katiz tries to throw a glass towards the bar tender Urgle and yells for help.

Renry tries to jump and grab.

Crowd goes for attacks.

Katiz and Renry both manage to not get hit.

They start fighting the crowd.

Lahrann becomes mist and disappears.

Lahrann has a 20 Wisdom score.

Guards come and subdue the situation.

Guards get Renry and Katiz out into the fields.

Breda goes shopping.

Dirt floor looks like the setup is somewhat impromptu.

Blacksmith candy store.

Breda - Bhalrus

Breda gets slightly ill fitting splint but it can be fixed.

Meets up with Renry and Katiz stumbling through the field to the shop.

Katiz wants Dilchucks.

Katiz heads to get Mely.

Renry goes to try to warn Ashren that Lahrahn is here.

Breda heads to bed.

---

Mely still in library. Gabrielle needs some sleep. Someone approaches Mely saying the library is closing but there's some magic effect going on. Hears a voice double over itself.

Mely rolls poorly then chronal shifts then gets silvery barbed. Feels cold and her shoulder lock up.

1 minute or cast remove curse Mely has disadvantage on wis saves. (??????????????????) Wonder if that was a prep for Geas? I don't think that makes sense though so it has to have been something else. Spell cast was probably Bestow Curse though.

Mely smartly bounces the fuck out of there. but still falls 30' oof.

Hears Lahrahn's devilish laughter follow after her (in her head.) 

Tries to stealth out and is running in fear basically.

---

Katiz goes to the library to get Mely. Guard isn't letting Katiz in. Katiz asks if someone matching Mely's old young elf description. Guard says no one is in the library. And that only the Head Librarian has come out in the last half hour.

---

Katiz meets up with Renry. They do some crazy shit in the middle of the street.

Mely eventually makes her way to them.
