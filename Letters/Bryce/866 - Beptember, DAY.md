Bryce,

Made it to Ghor'Alari! Unfortunately we're moving slower than I'd like but we're here right when we need to be. I hope you're managing alright without me being there. I have some good news and some bad news.

The bad news is that this is taking way longer than I expected it to and seems to be significantly more dangerous as well. I wish I could elaborate more but I don't think it's safe to do so just... keep an eye out and keep yourself safe okay?

The good news is that I've made some money along the way! I wasn't exactly expecting this trip to be even close to as lucrative as it has been. It also seems like my ability to weild Gond's magic has increased? We should be able to seriously increase output when I get back, or at the very least we can catch up at bit if we're behind on orders.

Will send you another letter when I start heading back to Kirkwall, which I hope will be in two or so days.

Keep yourself safe,
Breda
