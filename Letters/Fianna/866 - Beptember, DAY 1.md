Hey mom!

Just wanted to let you know that I made it to Ghor'Alari in one piece. Not for a lack of others trying to prevent that from happening. I have to say I've never been more thankful for all of the training you've put me through... sorry if I ever gave you a hard time about it.

I hope that ore has made its way to you by now. Can't wait to find out what ideas you're smithing up. 

If you want to send me any letters still direct them to the my shop in Kirkwall, I'm hoping to leave for there soon.

I've got a lot more I'd love to tell you about but they aren't the sorts of things you write. I know I don't need to tell you this but be weary and keep yourself safe. It seems the times are as safe as we'd all hope.

With Love,
Breda
