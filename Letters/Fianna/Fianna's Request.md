>To my daughter,
> I hope the festival is going as you expect. Make sure you set the displays so that the best pieces are directly behind you to frame yourself in your greatest work. Know that you are already a greater smith than most of the folk there and you're only getting better.
> 
> I have a simple request for you, my love. I've heard a rumor that the earth and ore around the great tower makes for exceptional blacksmithing. Retrieve some for me and yourself to return at your earliest convenience. It shouldn't be difficult to get there from the festival, yes?
