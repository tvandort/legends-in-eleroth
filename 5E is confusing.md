6. [Example scroll that is not a spell scroll](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5398-scroll-of-protection)
7. [Spells must have components to be perceptible](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/xgte/dungeon-masters-tools#Spellcasting:~:text=To%20be%20perceptible%2C%20the%20casting%20of%20a%20spell%20must%20involve%20a%20verbal%2C%20somatic%2C%20or%20material%20component.)

#### Counter arguments:
1. [Unclear how "ad hoc" components should be handled at all or when they would even become a thing. There are no rules about how to treat this. Why doesn't the ring of spell storing count as an "ad hoc" component? It clearly can't be countered. Same with wands?](https://twitter.com/jeremyecrawford/status/988882563501510656?lang=en)
2. [Implies that the spell can be countered but that's not what this tweet is even about so the answer doesn't really address this.](https://twitter.com/JeremyECrawford/status/786982774926249984)

You are blinded which means attack rolls against you are made with advantage. [But the enemy has disadvantage to see in the cloud.](A **heavily obscured** area--such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage--blocks vision entirely. A creature effectively suffers from the [blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Blinded) condition when trying to see something in that area.)
